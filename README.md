# Image Expanding Component

The Image Expanding Component is a mini project that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive card expansion feature.
When a user clicks on a card, the active card expands in size while the other cards simultaneously shrink, providing a visually engaging and dynamic user experience. 
This project aims to demonstrate the effective use of frontend web technologies to enhance interactivity and user engagement.


## Technologies Used:

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): Used for structuring the web page and defining the layout of the cards.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Utilized for styling and visually enhancing the cards, including transitions and animations.
- JavaScript: Employed to handle user interactions, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), and manage the card expansion functionality.

## Implementation Details:

- HTML Structure:
The web page consists of a container that holds multiple cards. Each card is defined as a separate HTML element, usually a "div", containing the necessary content, such as an image, text, or other media.
- CSS Styling:
CSS is utilized to style the cards and create a visually appealing design. It includes properties for setting card dimensions, borders, colors, transitions, and animations. These styles define the initial appearance of the cards and the transition effects when expanding or shrinking.  
- JavaScript Interactivity:
JavaScript plays a vital role in handling user interactions and managing the card expansion functionality. Event listeners are added to each card, listening for a click event. When a card is clicked, the JavaScript code is triggered, which modifies the CSS properties of the cards to achieve the desired expansion and shrinking effect. The active card is identified and assigned a larger size, while the other cards are simultaneously scaled down.
- Transition Effects:
CSS transitions and animations are applied to create smooth and visually pleasing effects when the cards expand and shrink. These effects can be customized to match the overall design of the application.
